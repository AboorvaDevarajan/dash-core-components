\description{
DatePickerSingle is a tailor made component designed for selecting a single day off of a calendar.  The DatePicker integrates well with the Python datetime module with the startDate and endDate being returned in a string format suitable for creating datetime objects.  This component is based off of Airbnb's react-dates react component which can be found here: https://github.com/airbnb/react-dates
